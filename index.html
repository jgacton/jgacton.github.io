                I am a penultimate-year undergraduate student studying for a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science at the University 
                of Bristol. I would like to pursue higher education and a career in quantitative finance, and to that end I am interning 
                this summer (2023) within the Risk Division at Goldman Sachs.<br>

                I also maintain an interest in existential risk, particularly regarding artificial intelligence and superintelligence.
                For my A-Level extended project, I wrote an essay titled "Will machine superintelligence benefit humanity?", covering 
                current ideas around what constitutes intelligence and superintelligence - and how we might get there. I then explore 
                what some of the political, economic, social, technical and ethical challenges of machine superintelligence might be.
